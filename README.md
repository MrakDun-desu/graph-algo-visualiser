# GAL_Project
Graph Algorithms project for FIT BUT

Source literature: Chapter 22 in the book Cormen et al - Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition, 2009

## Implementation requirements

- Loading and saving of created graphs (from/to a file)
- Basic visual editation of graphs
- Demonstration of an algorithm to find bridges and articulation points (ideally also showing biconnected components)
- Keybinds for algo demonstration is a plus
- [GraphML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML) as graph representation language
- Needs to be runnable on Merlin
- UI needs to be consulted with [Zbyněk Křivka](https://www.vut.cz/lide/zbynek-krivka-13784) before turning in the project

## Documentation requirements

- Mention all sources and libraries
- Program design, program description and how to control the program
- Short intro about program functionality
- Minimal requirements (architecture, OS, required software)
- Algorithm details (pseudocode and stuff)
- Mention the literature and possibly add more literature and other example apps if possible

## Turn-in requirements

One file with the source code, examples and documentation xsotol02.zip

## Presentation requirements

At [LTA student conference](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~meduna/work/lta) or at last/second to last lecture (6.12. or 13.12.).
Demonstrate program usage on example graphs that should be included in turned in file.
